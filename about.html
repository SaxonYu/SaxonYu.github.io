  Greetings, Internet Explorer! You've somehow navigated the wilds of the web and stumbled upon my digital domain. As Albert Einstein once said, “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” Hence, here, I strive not only to document and reflect on the journey I embark upon in the field of cybersecurity but also give 200% to distill complex ideas into accessible, understandable posts.

<h1>Why Cybersecurity?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
  Why cybersecurity, you might ask? Well, it's simple for me. I've always been into writing and messing with code, but to be honest, the whole Leetcode grind just wasn't my jam. I'm all about getting my hands dirty and seeing the immediate impact of what I do. That's exactly what cybersecurity gives me—it's the best of both worlds.

  That unforgettable moment when I first managed to crack a root shell on a victim machine? It was a game-changer. (Obviously, all in a controlled environment, duh.) The mix of excitement and a deep sense of accomplishment marked a pivotal moment for me.

        On the academic front, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Math at UCSD. Continuing on this path of discovery, I pursued a Master's in Information Security at CMU, a field that's as thrilling as it is crucial in our digital age.

        When it comes to free time, I'm looking to reconnect with my electric guitar. It's been a while, but I'm ready to bring music back into my life. It's not about hitting every note perfectly—it's about the process of learning and the enjoyment it brings. Games are also my break from the real world. Whether it's "League of Legends" or "Valorant", it's about jumping in with friends and having a laugh, maybe getting a bit competitive.

        So that's me. I'm just a guy who likes to keep it simple, whether I'm coding, jamming, or gaming.
